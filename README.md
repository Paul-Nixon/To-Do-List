# **Description**
This to-do list was inspired by [W3School's to-do list](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp) and created by implementing HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript.

The project was created w/the intent to get more JavaScript experience. Consequently, I added the Edit feature to the to-do list so I could make a unique version of W3School's app. Although my attempt was mostly successful, my version contains some glaring bugs. For example, when you click the form's Submit button w/o filling any of the inputs, an imperfect list item will still display. Also, I didn't tailor the to-do list for mobile, so each item's contents leave their respective container depending on how small the screen is.

I tried to fix these issues, but I decided to publish this anyway due to fatigue and frustration. At this point in my pursuit of a job, I prioritize releasing projects over efficiency/quality. Why would I spend more time fixing an annoying glitch/bug when I can just publish it? I'm already annoyed since I haven't seen much professional progress lately, and dealing w/glitches doesn't help the situation.

I'll ignore any comments about this project (I don't expect many) whether they're positive or negative because I need some time to fix my current mental state. I'll eventually get over this, but I'm just mentally tired atm.<br></br>
